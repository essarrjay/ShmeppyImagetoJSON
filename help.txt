    ► PALETTE attempts to convert image to Shmeppy fill tiles, using
        user-specified number of palette colors (maximum of 8
        colors).
      Result is a map with sharp color transitions, but has a poor
        result processing images containing many similar colors.

    ► FILTER RESIZE scales the image to the map size then converts
        pixels to Shmeppy tiles.
      Much faster, and result is an image with more of a color
        gradient. Good for landscapes with similar gradients,
        e.g. beaches, grass fields

    FILTER TYPES
      (from https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/concepts.html#filters)

      Listed in order increasing order of fidelity, decreasing order of speed.

      NEAREST - Pick one nearest pixel from the input image.
          Ignore all other input pixels.

      BOX - Each pixel of source image contributes to one pixel of
          the destination image with identical weights

      BILINEAR - Calculate the output pixel value using linear
          interpolation on all pixels that may contribute to the output
          value.

      HAMMING - Produces a sharper image than BILINEAR, doesn’t have
          dislocations on local level like with BOX.

      BICUBIC - Calculate the output pixel value using cubic
          interpolation on all pixels that may contribute to the output
          value.

      LANCZOS - Calculate the output pixel value using a high-quality
          Lanczos filter (a truncated sinc) on all pixels that may
          contribute to the output value.

        --------

    All methods preserve the aspect ratio of the map.
