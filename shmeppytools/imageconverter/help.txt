► Processing Options ◄
    ► FILTER RESIZE scales the image to the map size then converts
        pixels to Shmeppy tiles.
      Much faster, and result is an image with more of a color
        gradient. Good for landscapes with similar gradients,
        e.g. beaches, grass fields
      See below for the differences in types of filters.

    ► PALETTE attempts to convert image to Shmeppy fill tiles, using
        user-limited number of map palette colors.
      Colors in the map palette are generated by slicing the image into
        sample tiles, with each sample tile contributing a
        user-specified number of colors to the map palette.
      Result is a map with sharp color transitions, but may require
        fine tuning of sample tile size and palette size when
        processing images containing many similar colors.
      For speed of processing, you may choose to resize the map image
        before palette processing.

    ► MERGE will combine the edges and fills from two or more .json map
        files into a single file. Padding between maps can be set by
        the user. More than 2 maps can be specified if provided as
        space separated command line arguments.

    FILTER TYPES
      More info can be found on the project readme.
      Recommended filters (but consider trying a couple different ones):
        NEAREST - most crude and works ok for limited palette maps, but
            good for having sharp color transitions.
        LANCZOS - good with color gradients, bad in that it can make
            color gradients where you don't want them.
